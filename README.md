⭐ Project Objective (Resume-Ready)

To design and implement a smart home security and automation system using facial recognition, IoT sensors, and voice-controlled technology. The project aims to enhance home safety by detecting intruders, monitoring environmental hazards, and enabling remote control of home appliances through integrated cloud-based automation.

⭐ Problem Statement (Resume-Ready)

Traditional home security systems such as biometric locks, PIN codes, and password-based access are often costly, less accurate, and prone to security breaches. This project addresses the need for an affordable, reliable, and intelligent system by integrating facial recognition and IoT-based automation to create a secure, energy-efficient, and smart home environment.
